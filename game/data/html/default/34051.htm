<html><body>Shadai's Disciple Kaysia:<br>
Oh, hello! I'm Kaysia.<br>
I'm a blacksmith, and I learned from Grandpa Shadai. Well, I'm not a blacksmith officially. I don't really like being tied down in one place. Heh.<br>
However, I did find a strange Atelia piece, so I'm trying to find out more about it and will be staying here for a while.<br>
Even amongst those, <font color="LEVEL">Kelbim's Atelia Fragment</font> is very special. If you can bring me one, I'll work on that <font color="LEVEL">Kelbim's Atelia Fragment</font> and make you a <font color="LEVEL">Kelbim weapon</font>. Not bad, right?<br>
