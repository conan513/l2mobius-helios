Everything is plentiful here in Giran, which is why so many people spend their leisure time fishing. It's a sign of abundance!<br>
Oh, pardon me -- I'm O'Fulle, the only officially licensed fishing gear merchant in this territory! See me if you need to buy bait or sell fish. Fish only -- no mermaids! Haha!<br>
