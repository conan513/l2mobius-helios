The Town of Rune isn't like any other Elmore town! Its sheer scale is so huge that town itself is comprised of two different levels. People can use dimensional gates to move about the city!<br>
So, where would you like to go? The library?<br>
(If your <font color="LEVEL">main class</font> is <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 76 or below</font>, you can teleport for free.)<br>
