<html><body>Head Blacksmith Kusto:<br>
Well hello, stranger! I'm Head Blacksmith Kusto of the Black Anvil Guild. We're a trustworthy lot here. Unlike those Steel Door Guildies, our Guild is in it for more than just profits. We revel in the joy of creating something beautiful! To us, that takes precedence over the prospect of a few gold coins. The ability to bringing beauty and happiness into the light, now that's a worthwhile skill!<br>
So, what has brought you to my smithy, my friend? I'll gladly provide what help I can.<br>
