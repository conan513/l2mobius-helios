<html><body>High Priest Gregory:<br>
It's good to know there are reliable folk out there still. Too many are more mouth than action. I am High Priest Gregory.<br>
As you are no doubt aware, Goddard is all abuzz these days with rumors of war between the Varka Silenos and the Ketra Orcs, as well as news of the recent awakening of the fire dragon, Valakas. The strength of young warriors like you is desperately needed in these times.<br>
And we, the apostles of light, must provide guidance and wisdom...<br>
