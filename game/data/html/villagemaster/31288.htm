Welcome to Goddard, land of war and fire! In this place, blood boils as hot as the lava that flows from the volcanoes of the north!<br>
Those disgusting Varka Silenos and Ketra Orc tribes intend to battle nearby, and it is said that the Fire Dragon Valakas has awakened from its long slumber. Soon it will be time for the glorious warriors of Pa'agrio to arise, so do not be lax with your preparations!<br>
