I haven't seen you in these parts before. Just passing through?<br>
Admittedly, this place isn't the shining capital of Elmore any longer, but it's still an interesting place to tarry. It's full of imports, supplies, artisans, and flocking with interesting travelers. The only thing I regret is the quality of the local metal. We used to get a much better grade, but now, Ugh! Nothing pure about the stuff I've been seeing lately.<br>
