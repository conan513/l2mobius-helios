<html><body>Head Blacksmith Bolin:<br>
Welcome! I am Head Blacksmith Bolin of the Black Anvil Guild here in Schuttgart. After I've finished with you, my lad, you'll be a living testimony to the guild's prowess and prestige.<br>
Remember that for us crafting is not simply a profession -- it is our purpose in life. It is also our greatest strength, a strength so powerful that none can ignore it.<br>
Let the other races brag about their armies; we know how idle their boasts really are. How would they wage battle or lay siege to fortresses without the siege golems, weapons and armor that we create? Even their greatest warriors would be as helpless as newborn babes without our labors.<br>
Mark this well, youngster, craftsmanship is far more important than wielding a sword or casting some magic spell.<br>
