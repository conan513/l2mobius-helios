<html><body>High Priest Franco:<br>
May the glory of the light be with you.<br>
Life has brought me here so that I may teach and guide others through life's many passageways.<br>
Religion provides the guiding hand so many of us need, friend.<br>
It is the blanket that holds us up when we are weak.<br>
