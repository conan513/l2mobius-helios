The Adventure Guild gathers information on all adventures in all over the world and gives to adventurers. We're all-round information merchants. As you can imagine, we get real busy whenever events occur on the Aden Continent.<br>
Now that we're <font color="LEVEL">exchanging Adventurer's Marks and Seals</font> as well, we're even busier.<br>
