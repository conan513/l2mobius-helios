Do you want to get another weapon type? That's easy. But we are merchants! Nothing is free.<br>
We don't trade with just anyone. If you want to trade, give me <font color="LEVEL">1 Proof of Red</font>. Also, some <font color="LEVEL">Gemstones</font>. The amount depends on the grade of the weapon.<br>
When you switch a weapon, the <font color="LEVEL">enchantment, Soul Crystal, augmenting, and attributes</font> will remain the same. However, the appearance will be changed, so keep that in mind.<br>
