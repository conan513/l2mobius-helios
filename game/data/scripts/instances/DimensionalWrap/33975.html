I was first one to explore Dimensional Wrap. I heard that the imps here carry materials we could use -- rare books, things to enchant bracelets with, and the like.<br>
The Expeditioners have discovered that the probability of imps appearing increases with our use of Warp Crystals, but we have to use a lot to even think about getting up there.<br>
All members of the team should carry Warp Crystals. I'll divide them up according to the number in your group.<br>
I recently discovered the key to going upstairs directly. If you want, I can send you there.<br>
Okay, let's get started.<br>
