Preparations to make the ring are now complete. It will just take me a little while to get this flame hot enough. While I'm working on this, I don't know if your sponsor mentioned it, but you can acquire increased enlightenment. Enlightenment while you wait! What could be better?<br>
All you need to do is to go to the <font color="LEVEL">Blazing Swamp</font> and catch <font color="LEVEL">Hames Orc Footsoldier, Hames Orc Sniper, Hames Orc Shaman, and Hames Orc Prefects</font>. Then, collect <font color="LEVEL">12 Crystals of Experience</font>. <font color="LEVEL">The trick, there's always a trick, is that you must kill them while your sponsor is watching. If you don't, you won't be able to find any Crystals of Experience.</font> Strange, I know. But that's just how it works. And, it gives you a wonderful opportunity to show off to your sponsor, or... if you need it... your sponsor can give you a helping hand. Go on now. Have a good time.
