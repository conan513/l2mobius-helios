Good work. Now, using these transference bellows, I can heat the Crystals of Experience and make this manifestation of your training become part of your essence. Hold still now!<br>
There we go! That's it! So, how do you feel? Do you feel the enlightenment? It tickles, doesn't it? I know it's not a huge amount, but every little bit helps you grow. Ah, and here is your ring. I got it finished while you were out collecting crystals. I hope it helps you in your future endeavors.
