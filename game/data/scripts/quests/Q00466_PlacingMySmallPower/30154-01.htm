Just so you know...<br1><font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font> is the center of our Elf society. She is the mother of all living creatures and it is believed that the Elves were birthed from her very leaves. We exist only because of her and her health is vital to our existence.<br>
But, we fear that Mother Tree is dying. Her bark is rough, her leaves are falling. If we don't do something quickly, she may die! We can not allow that to happen!<br>
