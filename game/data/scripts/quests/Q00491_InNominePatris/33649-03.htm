Hahaha. No, babysitting this guy isn't the problem.<br>
These creatures all around us though, those are the problem. You see I'm not a very skilled Vanguard member. I'm much better at running away than fighting. But I can’t run with this guy around. If he dies, then my father is going to be super mad at me.<br>
I need someone to help protect me so I can protect him... which I guess is pretty much the same as protecting him.<br>
