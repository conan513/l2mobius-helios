No, I don't want you to do that, I just want you to eliminate some of these new monsters around here. If you do that, it pretty much makes my job significantly easier. I need you to hunt down and defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Succubus Soldiers, Succubus Warriors, Succubus Archers, and Succubus Shamans</font>. They should drop <font color="LEVEL">Dimensional Fragments</font>. Collect <font color="LEVEL">50</font> of these as proof that you have eliminated these mobs and I'll reward you for doing this.
