This isn't the first time we've met? You've completed a mission before? I see... Well, I don't really have a good memory.<br>
If you have completed a mission before, then that means you must have a Mark of Trust. What? You don't have one?<br>
Then you are either a liar, or you haven't been here in a long time. My trust is something you must continously try to maintain. Will you listen to me?<br>
