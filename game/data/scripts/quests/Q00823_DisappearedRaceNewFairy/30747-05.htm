<html><body>Fairy Mimyu:<br>
If the Nymphs are really fairies, I might be able to find out what happened in the Enchanted Valley with just a few clues. Please collect something that I could use as clues from the Nymphs.<br>
Please defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Nymph Rose, Nymph Lily, Nymph Tulip, Nymph Cosmos, and the Nymph Guardians</font> and bring the <font color="LEVEL">Nymph Stamens</font>. I'll need at least <font color="LEVEL">300</font> to find out anything from them. The more you bring, the better.<br>
I won't forget to reward you.
