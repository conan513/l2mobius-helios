<html><body>Dimensional Researcher Lias:<br>
That's great! I needed a lot of help with the operation to suppress the Dimensional Rift. Since I found out that a Dimensional Rift had appeared 
here, I carried out a battery of experiments to make my research more effective. I discovered something important in the process.<br>
Currently, monsters that look exactly like the monsters that used to exist in the Catacomb of the Witch are appearing here. But it's my judgment that this is just to hide the Dimensional Rift.<br>
The Lillim, Nephilim and Gigantics here are actually all illusions. They're monsters whose substance actually exists beyond 
the dimensional. At first, it was difficult to prove this, but with you joining the operation, that'il become much easier!<br>
