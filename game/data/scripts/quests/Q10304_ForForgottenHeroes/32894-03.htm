<html>body>Josephina's Companion Izael:<br>
Fortuna is currently occupied by <font color="LEVEL">Ron</font> and his followers. Ron became <font color="LEVEL">possessed</font> by the <font color="LEVEL">decaying darkness</font> in the Orbis Temple. He was expelled for the crime of raising his sword to Octavis. Then, he dared to enter and hide in Fortuna! Didn't the heroes who followed Josephina suffer enough by being forgotten? Now, even the resting place of their souls has been stolen!<br>
You seek the traces of Josephina! Won't you help me regain the eternal rest of the heroes?<br>
