So the Goddess of Death has opened her malicious eyes, at last. Shilen's vile creatures are rampaging all over Aden Castle. I heard a vanguard force from Aden Castle set out to eradicate those monsters and found an underground lair near the <font color="LEVEL">Seal of Shilen</font>. But the problem is that we haven't heard anything from them since then. So we're arranging to send a search party after them, and I hope you who of renown could help us with this mission. If you do, I'll help you gain greater powers.<br>
I shall be waiting for you in the <font color="LEVEL">Mystic Guild</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Aden</font>. Do not be led astray from your fated duty.<br>
(When your level is <font color="LEVEL">76</font> or higher, you can complete the <font color="LEVEL">third class transfer</font>)<br>
