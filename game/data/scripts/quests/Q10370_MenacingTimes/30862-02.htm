<html><body>Grand Master Oltran:<br>
The Aden Vanguard reports they have spotted several of <font color="LEVEL">Shilen`s creatures</font> entering Aden Territory from <font color="LEVEL">Goddard</font>. They do not believe that there is another attack planed for Aden but more of an impending attack on Goddard.<br>
If this is correct, then we might be able to pinpoint the source of where and how Shilen is able to send her creatures in Aden. The first priority is to alert Goddard that Shilen`s creatures are preparing to attack Goddard.<br>
Will you go to Goddard and give them this information?<br>
