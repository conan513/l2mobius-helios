Hmm... the rock can wait. There was an attack on Aden? That is very good news! I mean, that helps prove my theory. If yo track all of Shilen`s attacks or areas where she has icreased the number of her creatures you can see a correlation... looks like a search grid... she is <font color="LEVEL">looking for something</font>.<br>
Quickly, you have to hunt down <font color="LEVEL">Scavenger</font> <font color="LEVEL">Scarabs, Scavenger Ants, and Shrine Knights</font>  and bring me back samples of their <font color="LEVEL">Remnant Ashes</font>. To be on the safe side, please bring back 30 samples. They are already in the area so we must be quick before Shilen sends in her creations. Once I have these samples, it will help me determine if there is a threat to Goddard here or not.
