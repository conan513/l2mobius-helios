Exellent! Here are the creatures I need you to defeat.<br>
The easiest creatures are the <font color="LEVEL">Succubus Soldiers</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Succubus Warriors, Succubus Archers, and</font> <font color="LEVEL">Succubus Shamans</font>. The ones that make things more interesting are the Succubus Disciples. They are bit rarer than the others but you should be able to find enough in the area. I believe they are called <font color="LEVEL">Bloody Succubi</font>.<br>
Please defeat these creatures then let me know what you find.<br>
