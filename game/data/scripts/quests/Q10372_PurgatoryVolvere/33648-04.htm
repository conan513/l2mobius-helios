Exellent! As you mentioned, the strongest of the creatures is the <font color="LEVEL">Blood Succubus</font>. They are also known as Succubus Disciples, but that is beside the point.<br>
I need you to kill these creatures and extract from them their Essence. I need you to collect <font color="LEVEL">10</font> <font color="LEVEL">Succubus Essences</font> from their corpes before they turn to ash and bring them back to me. As soon as you return I can finish my report.
