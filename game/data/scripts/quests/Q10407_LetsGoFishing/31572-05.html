Oh, one more thing. I need to tell you about the <font color="LEVEL">Fishing Shot</font>. This is a kind of the Soulshot made for fishing. Use it while fishing to <font color="LEVEL">increase your odds of catching a fish</font>. For added convenience, register it in tool tips to use it automatically.<br>
Unfortunately, you're practicing at the moment, which means you're not eligible to receive a Fishing Shot just yet. If you take some time to prepare, you'll be done practicing in no time.<br>
That should be everything I need to explain. Let's get practicing now!<br>
