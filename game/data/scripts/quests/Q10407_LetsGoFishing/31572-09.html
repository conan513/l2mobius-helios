Then you'll need to prepare your fishing tools. You'll need a <font color="LEVEL">Fishing Rod</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Bait</font>. You can only fish if you have them. You can purchase these from me, but for now, I will lend them to you for practice. If you already have it, feel free to use it.<br>
