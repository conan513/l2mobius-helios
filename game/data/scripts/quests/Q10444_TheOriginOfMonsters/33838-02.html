Ah, you're Parajan's mercenary. I didn't recognize you.<br>
You've brought all the Chunks of a Corpse? Not many could find success in their work while facing the evil Baron Krogel. Please take this. It's a token of our gratitude for your help.<br>
Now, I should analyze the Chunks of a Corpse with magic. I'll report the results directly to Parajan. Thank you.
