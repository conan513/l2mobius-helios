<html><body>Rune Backup Trooper Parajan:<br>
There is a demon named Triol, one of four trying to resurrect Shilen. Using his own blood, he's brought another foul creature into our world.<br>
This new demon is called <font color="LEVEL">Krogel</font>. An otherworldly baron of arrogance, he is a corrupt shaman with <font color="LEVEL">the power to decompose and fuse corpses together</font> into new life.<br>
As if dying out here were not bad enough. Can you help us stop him?<br>
