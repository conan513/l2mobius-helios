You're a livesaver. All right, go find <font color="LEVEL">Krogel</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Land of Chaos</font>, and kill him.<br>
You can't completely kill off a demon of his ranking, but it will certainly cut the numbers of monsters created from corpses. <br>
As proof of his defeat, bring me <font color="LEVEL">2</font> <font color="LEVEL">Chunks of a Corpse</font>. <br>
Give the chunks to <font color="LEVEL">Investigator Quincy</font> for analysis. She might find a way to eliminate Krogel for good.
