Ah! You're the mercenary? Welcome!<br>
What...is this necklace? You're saying a monster really came out of a refugee's corpse? Can't be...!<br>
Pardon me. Here, a little something for your troubles. Thank you.<br>
Seriously, that Falk... dumping his work onto other people! Keep this up and I will have to tell the captain. <br>
Anyway, could you come by later if you get the chance? There is more work to be done around here, and I'll tell you about it if you're willing. <br>
