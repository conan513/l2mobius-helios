All right, go to Beleth's Magic Circle now. Take down as many monsters as you can, and the Circle will become unstable.<br>
When the <font color="LEVEL">magic Circle turns yellow</font>, kill off the nearby <font color="LEVEL">Decay Hannibals, Armor Beasts, Klein Soldiers, Disorder Warriors, Disorder Avatars, Blow Archers, Bizuards, Mutated Flys, Amos Soldiers, Amos Officers, Amos Master, and Ailith Hunters</font>. Then you'll be able to rescue those who haven't completely mutated yet!<br>
