Still not done? Well, we still have time. But hurry!<br>
Go to <font color="LEVEL">Beleth's Magic Circle</font> immediately and wait for <font color="LEVEL">the magic circle to turn yellow</font>. That's when you kill <font color="LEVEL">Decay Hannibals, Armor Beasts, Klein Soldiers, Disorder Warriors, Disorder Avatars, Blow Archers, Bizuards, Mutated Flies, Amos Soldiers, Amos Officers, Amos Masters, and Ailith Hunters</font>. Then you can rescue those who haven't completely mutated yet!
