Keep this in mind.<br>
First, <font color="LEVEL">augmentation options are assigned randomly</font>.<br1>
Second, <font color="LEVEL">augmented items cannot be exchanged or traded</font>.<br1>
Third, to augment, you need <font color="LEVEL">Life Stones</font>, or <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Gemstones</font>, but they are limited by the <font color="LEVEL">level at which they can be used</font>.<br>
Also, the amount of materials you need will increase as the level of the weapon increases. This should be enough. Are you ready?<br>
