Alright. The Soul Crystals are used <font color="LEVEL">to bestow special abilities onto weapons</font>. Before, you had to be in possession of Soul Crystals and defeat certain monsters to upgrade them. It used to be a dangerous procedure and troublesome, but those who sought to become stronger went through it anyway.<br>
But at some point, it became impossible to upgrade them that way. Well... with problems such as the <font color="LEVEL">fall of Ye Sagira</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">appearance of Faeron</font>, stuff like this is not unthinkable.<br>
