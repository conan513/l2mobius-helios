Alright. You can <font color="LEVEL">use a Soul Crystal to bestow a special ability onto weapons</font>. There have been some changes to the Soul Crystals, and now you can upgrade them by <font color="LEVEL">combining</font> them. That's why we have new Soul Crystals now.  <br>
The Soul Crystals from before cannot be used anymore. You can get the new Soul Crystals by defeating boss monsters, so remember that.<br>
If you need more information, check the instructions.
