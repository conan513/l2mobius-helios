<html><body>Giant's Minion Hansen:<br>
I was worried that I hadn't received a reply to my request for backup. I was starting to think that it was difficult for the Ertheia to make it all the way out here.<br>
I wonder if you have heard about the ancient monster <font color="LEVEL">Sakum</font>. We have gained intelligence that the ancient monster, who should have vanished years ago, was actually cloned by the <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font> and is currently in the <font color="LEVEL">Varka Silenos Barracks</font>.<br> 
It appears that the Embryo have colluded with the Varka Silenos. That means that we need to stop it right away. There is a lot work for us to do. Please come to me when you are done preparing.<br>
