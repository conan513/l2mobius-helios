If a clan is requested for disbanding, the clan gets disbanded.<br>
You can cancel disbanding through a clan recovery request within 1 week. Once it's canceled, you cannot request for disbanding again within 7 days.<br>
If a clan disbanding is requested, the Clan Leader will lose XP equivalent to his death. Realistically the Clan Leader cannot form a clan again for 10 days once the clan gets disbanded.<br>
Please note that any items left in the clan warehouse will disappear when a clan gets disbanded.<br>
